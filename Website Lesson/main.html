			<p>Here is a generic webpage layout template. This is the body, where the main content of a webpage goes. Read and answer the below questions and information using html code. Put your answer immedietly following each bullet and set your answer so that it is properly indented and in a <span>different color</span>. Your assignment is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
			</ul>
				<li>Study the html and css file of this webpage. Notice that there are 3 main sections marked by the tags, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &ltfooter&gt;. Also note that proper indentation is very important for reading html code.

				<li>Visit 5 random wesbites and see if you can identify the <b>header, main body</b>, and <b>footer</b> of each home page. Most sites follow this pattern, but some will not be so obvious. Once you have done that, edit this html file and list the websites you visited. Use html to make a list with bullet points or numbers of the websites and each with a hyperlink to their respective site. This webpage already already has examples of this so just take look at the html file. If you want to see other html tags, just go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>.</li>

					<!-- Put your website information here -->

				<li>Try right-clicking and selecting <b>"view page source"</b> to see the html of different webpages. Most sites compress their code to save space (remove all white space so everything is crammed together) but some sites will clearly show their tags and how everything is organized. Be ready to explain to Dad what you found when looking at the code.</li>

				<li>Read about html comments, and these html tags: &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, and &lt;head&gt; on Google or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>. Answer the following questions:
					<ol>
						<li>Briefly explain the purpose and history of the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag.</li>

							<!-- Your answer goes here -->

						<li>What do html opening and closing tags look like? Do all html tags need to be closed? If no, which don't?</li>

							<!-- Your answer goes here -->

						<li>Briefly explain the purpose and history of the &lt;html&gt; tag.</li>

							<!-- Your answer goes here -->

						<li>What information should you put in the &lt;head&gt; tag? Does the information in this tag show up on your webpage? </li>
					</ol>
				</li>

				<p>Once you are finished with your assignment, get Dad to review it. If the answers are good and in a nice, readable format, (both the html code and what it looks like on this site), there may be a reward.
				</li>

		<footer>
			<p>The website's footer, usually where you put links, copyrights, disclaimers, etc.</p>
